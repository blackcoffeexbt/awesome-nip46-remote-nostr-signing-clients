# Awesome NIP46 - Remote Nostr Signing

A list of Nostr clients that support NIP46 and a list of NIP46 remote signers.

## What is NIP46?

NIP 46 is the specification for how clients can use a remote signer with a Nostr client. This allows for:

+ More secure Nostr key use, especially on mobile web clients where extensions might not be available
+ Key delegation - Multiple users can share a Nostr private key and have access revoked by ther key owner
